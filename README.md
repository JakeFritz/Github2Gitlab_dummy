This is a dummy-project to test the integration of Gitlab-CI into Repos hosted on Github.

Steps to be done:

- Allow Force-Push on remote protected branches in remote Repo
- Create Personal Access Token in GitLab,
so that the GitHub-CI can push to GitLab
- This Token needs the necessary permissions (t.b.d.)
